Search API Terms of Service
Last modified March 11, 2013

These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) apply to your access and use the application programming interface that is made available on this website (the "API"), and any and all data, images, text, or other information or content transmitted through the API (the "Mouser Electronics Data"). “We” “us” and “our” means Mouser Electronics, Inc. or any of its subsidiary companies (“Mouser Electronics”), as the case may be. “You” or “your” means the applicant. The API may allow you to access Mouser Electronics Data on one or more Mouser Electronics sites. If you use the API to access or use such Mouser Electronics Data, you agree to comply and be bound by the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy of each applicable Mouser Electronics site.

BY CHECKING THE BOX INDICATING THAT YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS, OR BY ACCESSING OR USING THE API OR MOUSER ELECTRONICS DATA, YOU (A) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS; AND (B) HEREBY REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE LAWFULLY ABLE TO ENTER INTO CONTRACTS (E.G., YOU ARE NOT A MINOR). IN ADDITION, IF THE TERMS ARE BEING AGREED TO BY A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, THEN THE PERSON AGREEING TO THE TERMS ON BEHALF OF THAT COMPANY OR ENTITY HEREBY REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT HE OR SHE IS AUTHORIZED AND LAWFULLY ABLE TO BIND THAT COMPANY OR ENTITY TO THE TERMS.

1. Purpose

The API is made available by Mouser Electronics to enable others to access commercially valuable Mouser Electronics Data and present it to their end users within their web sites and software applications (“Application”) in ways that compliment and enhance Mouser Electronics’s own products and services (“Permitted Purposes”). Any use of the API that is competitive to or inconsistent with Mouser Electronics’ own products and services, aggregates, in any way, any Mouser Electronics Content with third party content (without distinction) or fails to attribute the Mouser Electronics Data appropriately to Mouser Electronics is expressly not permitted. Mouser Electronics reserves the right to continually review and evaluate all uses of the API, and will determine whether specific uses of the API are Permitted Purposes or not permitted in its sole discretion. Mouser Electronics' failure to immediately terminate any user of the Mouser Electronics API for a non-permitted purpose shall in no way be construed as a waiver of its ability to terminate such user later or any other user. Mouser Electronics reserves the right to request information related to your use of any Mouser Electronics API and your compliance with these Terms. Failure to timely and completely respond to such request may result in termination.

2. Enrollment and Suitability

To begin the enrollment process, you must submit a complete and accurate access request form. In your access request form, you must describe the Application you intend to develop and use with the API or on which you intend to display Mouser Electronics Data. We will evaluate your access request form and notify you by email of its acceptance or rejection. We reserve the right to reject your enrollment form for any reason, in our sole discretion, in the event we determine that your Application is unsuitable. Unsuitable applications include, but are not limited to those applications that:

do not have as their principal purpose advertising and marketing the Mouser Electronics Content and driving sales of Mouser Electronics products and services ;
promote or contain sexually explicit materials;
contain hate/violent/offensive content or any other material deemed unsuitable or harmful to the reputation of Mouser Electronics;
promote discrimination, or employ discriminatory practices, based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age;
promote or undertake illegal activities or otherwise violate applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, orders, and other requirements of any governmental authority that has jurisdiction over you, including, but not limited to, laws that govern marketing email;
include "Mouser", “Mouser Electronics,” or any other trademark of Mouser Electronics or its affiliates, or variations or misspellings of any of them, in their URLs to the left of the top-level domain name (e.g., ".com," ".net," ".org"); or
infringe on our or any other person’s or entity’s intellectual property, privacy, data protection or other rights.
If we reject your enrollment form, you are welcome to reapply at any time. However, if we accept your access request form and we later determine that your Application is unsuitable, we may terminate the Terms.

You will ensure that the information included in your access request form, including your contact information and the description of your Application, is at all times complete, accurate, and up-to-date.

By enrolling, you will be issued one or more unique security keys, secrets, tokens, passwords and/or other credentials (collectively, "Key(s)") for accessing the API and managing your account. You may only access your account with the Key(s) issued to you by Mouser Electronics. Access may not always be available. You may not sell, transfer, sublicense or otherwise disclose your Key(s) to any other party or use them with any application other than that for which you initially applied for . You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy and security of your Key(s). You are fully responsible for all activities that occur using your Key(s), regardless of whether such activities are undertaken by you or a third party. You should contact us immediately if you believe that someone other than you may be using your Key(s) or if your Key(s) is otherwise lost or stolen.

3. Inaccessibility of the API

You understand and agree that from time to time the API may be inaccessible, unavailable or inoperable for any reason, including, without limitation: (i) equipment malfunctions; (ii) periodic updates, maintenance procedures or repairs; or (iii) causes beyond the control of Mouser Electronics or which are not reasonably foreseeable by Mouser Electronics, including, without limitation, interruption or failure of telecommunication or digital transmission links, hostile network attacks, the unavailability, operation, or inaccessibility of websites or interfaces, network congestion or other failures. You acknowledge and agree that Mouser Electronics has no control over the availability of the services on a continuous or uninterrupted basis.

4. API Restrictions

By making calls to the API or accessing Mouser Electronics Data, you agree that you will not, and will not assist or enable others to:

cache, record, pre-fetch, or otherwise store any portion of the Mouser Electronics Content, or attempt or provide a means to execute any “bulk download” operations;
modify the Mouser Electronics Content (except modifications to the Mouser Electronics landing page URL as required to facilitate tracking by third parties authorized by Mouser Electronics), or use it to update or create your own database of business listing information;
display Mouser Electronics Data in a manner that could reasonably imply an endorsement, relationship or affiliation with or sponsorship between you or a third party and Mouser Electronics, other than your permitted use of the API under the Terms;
copy, rent, lease, sell, transfer, assign, sublicense, dissemble, reverse engineer or decompile (except to the limited extent expressly authorized under applicable statutory law), modify or alter any part of the API;
use the API in a manner that impacts the stability of Mouser Electronics’s servers or impacts the behavior of other applications using the API; or
use the API or Mouser Electronics Data in any manner or for any purpose that may violate any applicable law or regulation, or any right of any person including, but not limited to, intellectual property rights, rights of privacy and/or data protection, or which otherwise may be harmful (in Mouser Electronics’s sole discretion) to Mouser Electronics, its providers, its suppliers, end users of this website, or your end users.
5. Limited License and Attribution

The API, including without limitation all Mouser Electronics Data, is owned by or licensed to Mouser Electronics or our third-party content providers. Subject to the terms set forth in these Terms, and as long as you have a current and valid Key(s), Mouser Electronics grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to copy and display the Mouser Electronics Data solely on your Application. You may not use the API or Mouser Electronics Data for any other purpose without Mouser Electronics’s prior written consent. Other than the limited license expressly set forth in this Section 5, we reserve all right, title and interest in and to the API, the Mouser Electronics Data, our and our affiliates’ trademarks and logos and any other intellectual property and technology that we provide or use in connection with the API or the Mouser Electronics Data.

You must clearly and conspicuously attribute the source of all Mouser Electronics Data as received from Mouser Electronics. You may not modify, obscure or otherwise disable the functioning of links to Mouser Electronics or third-party applications or websites provided within the Mouser Electronics Data. Similarly, you may not omit, modify, or obscure text, images, artwork, logos, copyright or similar notices of any Mouser Electronics Data that you receive from the API, provided however, that with graphic images, you may re-size such images while maintaining the same relative proportions of the image.

You acknowledge and agree that Mouser Electronics may monitor your Application in order to confirm compliance with the Terms and may request information at any time to support your compliance with the Terms. Should you fail to provide responsive information, or if Mouser Electronics, in its sole discretion, determines that you are not complying with the Terms, Mouser Electronics may terminate your license and invalidate your Key(s) with or without notice to you. Upon such termination for any reason, you shall immediately cease using the API and Mouser Electronics Data and promptly remove from your Application and delete or otherwise destroy any portion of all Mouser Electronics Data, as requested by us.

6. Obligations Regarding Your Application

You are solely responsible for, and we have no liability for, the development, operation, or maintenance of your Application or for any materials contained on your Application.

You agree that, following notice from Mouser Electronics, you will promptly remove any search listing containing copy and/or creative components that Mouser Electronics, in its sole discretion, deems inappropriate for any reason.
You agree that you will not exceed the number of calls assigned to you by Mouser Electronics. If you anticipate exceeding call limitations, contact us and we can discuss your particular situation. Mouser Electronics may, at its sole discretion, choose to increase call limits in certain situations. Repeat violations of the call limit may result in revocation of your right to use the API.
7. Term and Termination

The Terms will take effect upon our acceptance of your access request application and will end when terminated by either party. Either you or Mouser Electronics may terminate the Terms at any time, with or without cause, by giving the other party written notice of termination. Upon any termination of the Terms, any and all licenses you have with respect to the API and Mouser Electronics Data will automatically terminate and you will immediately stop using the API, and promptly remove from your Application and delete or otherwise destroy all Mouser Electronics Data and any other materials provided or made available by or on behalf of us to you under the Terms or otherwise in connection with the API. In addition, we may terminate or suspend your license to access and use the API or any part of or all Mouser Electronics Data at any time without terminating the Terms by giving you written notice.

Upon any termination of the Terms , all rights and obligations of the parties will be extinguished, except that the rights and obligations of the parties under Sections 5, 6, 8, and 11-20 will survive the termination of the Terms . No termination of the Terms will relieve either party for any liability for any breach of, or liability accruing under, the Terms prior to termination.

It is your responsibility to check the Terms for updates. If any modification is unacceptable to you, you agree that your only recourse is to discontinue use of the API. Your continued usage of the API after our posting of a change notice will constitute binding acceptance of the change.
